- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @a-urq
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in meteorology, weather photography, rock climbing, and metal/hardcore punk music. My current main project is an open-source radar viewer, and I plan to also make a Numerical Weather Prediction model viewer later down the line.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning C++ and OpenGL.
- üßó I'm currently getting into astrophotography. I've made images of many nebulae and a few galaxies outside our own, up to 21.6 million light years away.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm currently collaborating with the Chase Archive team to produce radar and satellite loops for each case submitted to the archive, and with Kelton Halbert to produce ECAPE parcels for [SHARPlib](https://github.com/keltonhalbert/SHARPlib/).
- üì´ I can be best reached at amelia.r.urquhart@gmail.com. Beware, I don't check my email as often as I should.

# Contributions
- Currently contributing radar and satellite plots (not yet deployed at time of writing) for the [Chase Archive](https://app.chasearchive.com/).
- [SHARPlib](https://github.com/keltonhalbert/SHARPlib/): Currently contributing to the integration of Peters et al. 2022 parcel computations, which include dry air entrainment.
- <a href="https://github.com/kylejgillett/sounderpy">SounderPy</a>: Contributed to the integration of <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/ecape-parcel-py">ecape_parcel_py</a>'s parcel computation logic. More contributions are ongoing.

# Currently Active Personal Projects
## Python
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/ecape-parcel-py">ecape_parcel_py</a>: A Python package that computes entrainment CAPE parcels as well as irreversible adiabatic ascent parcels according to <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/79/3/JAS-D-21-0118.1.xml">Peters et. al. 2022</a>. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/ecape-parcel-py">solar_wind_archive</a>: A simple Python package that retrieves ACE solar wind data from any time between 2001 and the present. Licensed under the MIT License.
## Java
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/radarview">RadarView</a>: A free and open-source radar viewing program meant to have many advanced features such as precipitation types and vertical atmospheric profiles. Currently undergoing a rewrite from the ground up. Licensed under GPLv3.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/sounding-viewer-java">Sounding Viewer</a>: An open-source visualizer for vertical profiles ("soundings") of the atmosphere. Can be used as a GUI application, a command line tool, or as an API to display soundings as a part of your own programs. You may either use data from weather balloon launches or supply your own data to be visualized. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/ecape4j">Ecape4J</a>: A Java library that computes ECAPE values and parcel paths. Now released and ready for use. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/wx-archives">WxArchives</a>: An interface for the AWS NEXRAD Level-II archive as well as other meteorological archive data sources, such as the Iowa State Watch, Warning, and Advisory Archive. Currently in Beta. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/weather-utils-java">Weather Utils</a>: The backend that makes both RadarView and Sounding Viewer work. A large collection of meteorology and atmospheric science related methods meant for easy use in projects involving such calculations. Currently in development, new methods are added often. Somewhat like what MetPy is for Python projects. C++ and Pythons versions to come later. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/srtm-wrapper-java">SRTM Wrapper</a>: A small but important part of RadarView, containing a modified version of the data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset. Downsampled to a 90 meter resolution to save space. Only contains data for North America south of 60N. Elevation data is stored locally within the project, so this library does *not* require an internet connection to function properly. Licensed under the MIT License.
