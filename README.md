- 👋 Hi, I’m @a-urq
- 👀 I’m interested in Meteorology, Weather Photography, and Heavy Metal Music. My current main project is an open-source radar viewer, and I plan to also make a Numerical Weather Prediction model viewer later down the line.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, LWJGL, GLSL, WebGL, and Vue.js
- 🧗 I'm currently getting into rock climbing. I'm working on V2 and V3 routes as of the time of writing.
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating on a web-based weather model viewer for the Oklahoma Weather Lab. In particular, I am working on adding a radar data display. I also am working on the backend for making streamwise vorticity and isentropic analysis charts.
- 📫 I can be best reached at amelia.r.urquhart@gmail.com. Beware, I don't check my email as often as I should.

# Currently Active Personal Projects
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/radarview">RadarView</a>: A free and open-source radar viewing program meant to have many advanced features such as precipitation types and vertical atmospheric profiles. Currently in Beta. Performance is currently a big issue, and that is the focus of the next Beta Version release currently in development. Licensed under GPLv3.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/sounding-viewer-java">Sounding Viewer</a>: An open-source visualizer for vertical profiles ("soundings") of the atmosphere. Can be used as a GUI application, a command line tool, or as an API to display soundings as a part of your own programs. You may either use data from weather balloon launches or supply your own data to be visualized. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/ecape4j">Ecape4J</a>: A simple library that computes ECAPE according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04712.pdf">Peters et. al. 2023</a>. This library will also soon be able to compute the entrained parcel path, which will open the door to entrained convective parameters (LCL, EL, etc). Currently in Beta. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href="https://github.com/a-urq/nexrad-aws-java">NexradAws4J</a>: An interface for the AWS NEXRAD Level-II archive as well as other meteorological archive data sources, such as the Iowa State Watch, Warning, and Advisory Archive. Currently in Beta. Inspired by the Python package <a href="https://github.com/aarande/nexradaws/">nexradaws</a>. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/weather-utils-java">Weather Utils</a>: The backend that makes both RadarView and Sounding Viewer work. A large collection of meteorology and atmospheric science related methods meant for easy use in projects involving such calculations. Currently in development, new methods are added often. Somewhat like MetPy for Python projects. C++ and Pythons versions to come later. Licensed under the MIT License.
-   <a href = "https://github.com/a-urq/srtm-wrapper-java">SRTM Wrapper</a>: A small but important part of RadarView, containing a modified version of the data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset. Downsampled to a 90 meter resolution to save space. Only contains data for North America south of 60N. Elevation data is stored locally within the project, so this library does *not* require an internet connection to function properly. Licensed under the MIT License.

I have also begun a library to contain snippets of code I find myself using over and over again in my various projects. It will likely be uploaded here as a dependency for my other projects.
